- **Prevents Flashing**: Ensures smooth window appearance without white flashing

## Design Philosophy

### Color Palette
- **Primary Background**: `#2c2c2e` (Dark macOS window background)
- **Secondary Background**: `rgba(58, 58, 60, 0.8)` (Card/form elements)
- **Text Primary**: `#ffffff` (Main text)
- **Text Secondary**: `#98989d` (Descriptions, hints)
- **Accent**: `#007aff` (Primary blue for buttons and focus states)
- **Borders**: `rgba(99, 99, 102, 0.3)` (Subtle borders)

### Typography
- **Font**: SF Pro Display system font stack
- **Weights**: Proper hierarchy with 700 for headers, 500 for labels, 400 for body text
- **Spacing**: Consistent letter-spacing and line-height for readability

### Animations
- **Entrance**: fadeIn animation (0.4s ease-out) for all main content
- **Interactions**: Smooth hover states with transform and box-shadow
- **Performance**: Hardware acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`

### Interactive Elements
- **Buttons**: Consistent styling with hover lift effects and glow
- **Form Fields**: Dark backgrounds with blue focus states
- **Toggle Switches**: macOS-style toggles with smooth transitions
- **Cards**: Rounded corners with subtle shadows and borders

## Performance Optimizations

### CSS Performance
- **Hardware Acceleration**: `transform: translateZ(0)` and `will-change` properties
- **Layout Containment**: `contain: layout style paint` to prevent layout thrashing
- **Font Smoothing**: Antialiased text rendering for crisp typography

### Loading Performance
- **Critical CSS**: Inlined critical styles for immediate rendering
- **CSS Preloading**: Preload stylesheets for faster loading
- **Background Colors**: Match window backgrounds to prevent flashing
