# MULTI-SHARE "OPEN FOLDER" IMPROVEMENT

## Issue Summary
The user requested an improvement to the "Open Folder" functionality when multiple network shares are mounted. Previously, the app would only open the first mounted share, making it difficult for users to access other mounted drives quickly.

## Problem Description

### Before the Fix
- ❌ **Limited Access**: Only the first mounted share could be opened
- ❌ **Poor UX**: Users had to navigate through the "Mounted Drives" submenu to access specific shares
- ❌ **No Choice**: No way to select which share to open when multiple were available
- ❌ **Inflexible**: Power users with many shares had very limited quick access

### User Request
> "One issue is when the user mounts more than one share network drive, can you please make sure that the button 'Open Folder' can also choose what share to open?"

## Solution Implementation

### 🎯 **Intelligent Tray Menu Behavior**

The tray menu "Open Folder" option now adapts based on the number of mounted shares:

#### **0 Shares Mounted**
```
🔴 Open Folder (No shares mounted) [DISABLED]
```

#### **1 Share Mounted**
```
🟢 Open Folder (NAS Drive) [DIRECT CLICK]
```
- Shows share name in the label
- Direct click opens the share immediately
- Maintains fast access for single-share users

#### **2+ Shares Mounted**
```
🟢 Open Folder ▶
    ├─ 📁 NAS Drive
    ├─ 📁 Media Server  
    ├─ 📁 Documents
    ├─ ────────────────
    └─ 📂 Open All Shares
```
- Smart submenu with individual share options
- Each share shows with folder icon and clear label
- "Open All Shares" option for convenience
- Supports unlimited number of shares

### 🎯 **Enhanced Main Window Dialog**

The main window "Open Folder" button now provides a selection dialog for multiple shares:

#### **Multiple Share Selection Dialog**
```
Multiple shares are mounted. Choose which one to open:

1. NAS Drive (//workstation/nas)
2. Media Server (//server/media)  
3. Documents (//office/docs)
4. Backup Drive (//backup/drive)

Enter the number (1-4) or 'all' to open all shares: _
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Clear numbering system (1, 2, 3...)
- ✅ Shows both share labels and paths
- ✅ Special "all" keyword to open all shares
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Cancellation support
- ✅ Progress feedback for batch operations

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

#### **1. Refactored Share Opening Logic**
```typescript
async function openSpecificShare(share: any): Promise<void> {
    // Network connectivity check
    // Safety validation with timeout
    // Error handling and notifications
    // Shell.openPath with timeout protection
}
```

#### **2. Smart Menu Generation**
```typescript
function createOpenFolderSubmenu(): any[] {
    // Returns empty array for 0-1 shares (no submenu needed)
    // Creates individual share options for 2+ shares
    // Adds "Open All" option with separator
}
```

#### **3. Adaptive Menu Labels**
```typescript
function getOpenFolderLabel(): string {
    // "Open Folder (No shares mounted)" for 0 shares
    // "Open Folder (ShareName)" for 1 share  
    // "Open Folder" for 2+ shares (submenu handles details)
}
```
