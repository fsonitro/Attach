# SMB Mount Management - Enhanced Features

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. **Automatic Directory Cleanup**
- **Problem**: When shares were unmounted, directories remained in `~/mounts/`
- **Solution**: Enhanced unmount function with robust cleanup
- **Features**:
  - Automatically removes mount directories after unmounting
  - Handles both empty and non-empty directories
  - Fallback cleanup mechanisms for edge cases

### 2. **Orphaned Mount Detection**
- **Problem**: Network disconnections left orphaned mount directories
- **Solution**: Periodic validation and cleanup system
- **Features**:
  - Checks every 30 seconds for disconnected shares
  - Automatically removes inaccessible mount points from the app
  - Cleans up orphaned directories in `~/mounts/`

### 3. **Enhanced Mount Location Strategy**
- **Problem**: `/Volumes/` required sudo permissions
- **Solution**: Use `~/mounts/` directory in user's home
- **Benefits**:
  - No sudo prompts or permissions required
  - Faster mount/unmount operations
  - Better user experience

### 4. **Proper Password URL Encoding**
- **Problem**: Special characters in passwords (`$,bkiXktc{MrfP==9zz~`) caused URL parsing failures
- **Solution**: Use `encodeURIComponent()` for proper URL encoding
- **Handles**: `$`, `{`, `}`, `=`, `~`, `,`, and other special characters

## üîÑ HOW IT WORKS

### Automatic Cleanup Process
1. **Every 30 seconds**, the app validates all mounted shares
2. **Checks accessibility** of each mount point
3. **Detects disconnected shares** (network issues, server down, etc.)
4. **Removes orphaned directories** automatically
5. **Updates tray menu** to reflect current state

### Manual Cleanup Options
- **Tray Menu**: "Cleanup Orphaned Mounts" option
- **IPC Handler**: `cleanup-orphaned-mounts` for renderer processes
- **App Startup**: Automatic cleanup on application launch

### Enhanced Unmount Process
1. **Gentle unmount** attempt first
2. **Forced unmount** if gentle fails
3. **Directory verification** and cleanup
4. **Robust error handling** with fallback mechanisms
5. **Complete removal** of mount directories

## üìÅ DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

```
~/mounts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ felipe-1749115xxx/  # Active mount
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ felipe-1749116xxx/  # Another active mount
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .DS_Store          # System file (ignored)
```

**After disconnection/unmount**: Directories are automatically removed

## üéõÔ∏è USER INTERFACE

### Tray Menu Options
- **Mounted Drives** ‚Üí Shows all active mounts
- **Unmount All** ‚Üí Unmounts all shares and cleans directories
- **Cleanup Orphaned Mounts** ‚Üí Manual cleanup trigger
- **Open Mounter** ‚Üí Access mount interface

### Mount Window
- Handles special characters in passwords automatically
- No longer requires admin privileges
- Better error messages and feedback

## üîç MONITORING & LOGGING

The app provides detailed console logging for:
- Mount/unmount operations
- Cleanup activities
- Orphaned directory detection
- Error handling and troubleshooting

Example log output:
```
Cleaned up orphaned mount directory: /Users/felipe/mounts/felipe-1749114939160
Cleaned up 2 orphaned mount directories
Share felipe-1749115xxx is no longer accessible, removing from list
Successfully unmounted: /Users/felipe/mounts/felipe-1749115xxx
```

## ‚ú® BENEFITS

1. **Zero Manual Cleanup**: App manages all mount directories automatically
2. **No Orphaned Files**: Disconnected shares are detected and cleaned
3. **No Sudo Requirements**: All operations in user space
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Handles network issues gracefully
5. **Real-time Updates**: Tray menu reflects current state immediately
6. **Special Character Support**: Passwords with special characters work reliably

This enhanced system ensures that your `~/mounts/` directory stays clean and only contains actively mounted, accessible network shares.
