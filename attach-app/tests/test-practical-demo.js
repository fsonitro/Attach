console.log('üéØ PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION: System Mount Conflict Resolution');
console.log('=' .repeat(65));

console.log('\nüìã ORIGINAL ISSUE:');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ User reported: "app is trying to mount a share drive that is already been mounted"');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Share was mounted by macOS file system (probably through Finder)');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ User had to manually eject the share before app could mount it');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ This created a poor user experience');

console.log('\nüîß SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Enhanced MountCoordinator with system mount detection');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Automatic conflict resolution before mounting');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Integration with existing stale mount cleanup system');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ User notifications for transparency');

console.log('\nüí° HOW IT WORKS NOW:');
console.log('   1. User tries to mount a share (or auto-mount runs)');
console.log('   2. MountCoordinator.coordinateMount() is called');
console.log('   3. Before mounting, checks for system mount conflicts');
console.log('   4. If conflict found (share already mounted by Finder/system):');
console.log('      ‚Üí Automatically ejects the existing mount');
console.log('      ‚Üí Notifies user: "Mount Conflicts Resolved"');
console.log('      ‚Üí Proceeds with app-managed mount');
console.log('   5. If no conflict, proceeds with normal mount');

console.log('\nüéØ CONFLICT DETECTION LOGIC:');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Uses detectMountConflict(sharePath) from SMB service');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Scans all system SMB mounts using `mount | grep smbfs`');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Compares share paths to find conflicts');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Distinguishes between app-managed and system mounts');

console.log('\nüßπ CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROCESS:');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Uses cleanupStaleMounts(sharePath) for resolution');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Tries diskutil eject for /Volumes/ mounts (Finder)');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Falls back to umount for other mount types');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Uses umount -f as last resort');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ 10-second timeout prevents hanging');

console.log('\nüì± USER EXPERIENCE:');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ BEFORE: Manual ejection required, mount would fail');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ AFTER: Automatic resolution, transparent to user');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Notification shows what was resolved');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ No manual intervention needed');

console.log('\nüîÑ INTEGRATION POINTS:');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Auto-mount on startup: Checks conflicts before mounting');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Manual mount from UI: Uses same conflict resolution');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Network reconnection: Handles stale mounts automatically');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ All mount operations benefit from this enhancement');

console.log('\nüìä ROBUSTNESS FEATURES:');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Graceful degradation if conflict detection fails');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Mount proceeds normally if resolution times out');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Existing mount logic handles remaining conflicts');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ No breaking changes to existing functionality');

console.log('\nüéâ RESULT:');
console.log('   ‚úÖ No more manual ejection required');
console.log('   ‚úÖ Seamless mounting experience');
console.log('   ‚úÖ Transparent conflict resolution');
console.log('   ‚úÖ Better user experience');
console.log('   ‚úÖ Robust error handling');

console.log('\n' + '=' .repeat(65));
console.log('üöÄ SOLUTION READY FOR TESTING');
console.log('=' .repeat(65));

console.log('\nüìù TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:');
console.log('   1. Mount a share through Finder (Go ‚Üí Connect to Server)');
console.log('   2. Try to mount the same share through the app');
console.log('   3. App should automatically detect and resolve the conflict');
console.log('   4. Should see notification: "Mount Conflicts Resolved"');
console.log('   5. Mount should succeed without manual intervention');

console.log('\nüîç DEBUGGING:');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Check console logs for conflict detection messages');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Look for: "System mount conflict detected"');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Look for: "Successfully resolved X mount conflicts"');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Notifications will show resolved conflict count');
